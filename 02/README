Boolean Arithmetic

Continuing with combinational logic, specify and build a set of adders. half-adder, full-adder, and parallel adder.
Next, specify an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) which can perform basic arithmetic, and describe its proposed implementation.

HalfAdder.hdl - The HalfAdder chip.
FullAdder.hdl - The FullAdder chip.
Add16.hdl - The Add16 chip.
Inc16.hdl - The Inc16 chip.
ALU.hdl - The ALU chip.
ShiftLeft.hdl - The ShiftLeft chip.
ShiftRight.hdl - The ShiftRight chip.
LogicalShiftLeft.hdl - The LogicalShiftLeft chip.
Mul.hdl - The Mul chip.

Remarks
-------
I used the LogicalShiftLeft chip in the Mul chip, which doesn't reserve the sign, but just shifts the bits in the 
number to the left for the long multiplication purpose.
