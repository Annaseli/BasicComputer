                           Project 1 - An HDL File
                           ----------------------- 
Beginning at the Nand level, specify and build a set of elementary logic gates, multiplexors, and their multi-bit versions.
In addition, describe how chips can be built and tested using a simple version of HDL (Hardware Description Language) and the supplied Hardware Simulator.
