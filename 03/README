Sequential Logic

Beginning with D-Flip-Flops (DFFs), which can "remember" inputs and output them later, build a recursive hierarchy of memory systems: 1-bit register, 
multi-bit register, and a Random Access Memory (RAM).
Also build a counter chip, which will later function as the computer's program counter.
