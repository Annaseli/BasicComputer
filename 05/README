 Computer Architecture
 
Specify a simple machine language, giving both its binary and symbolic instruction sets, and build a central-processing-unit (CPU) that can receive 
such instructions as an input. Next, integrating all the previously built chips into a unified architecture, capable of executing programs written 
in the specified language.
Specify how the architecture interacts with memory-mapped screen and keyboard devices.
This completes the construction of the hardware platform.
